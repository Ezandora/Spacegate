Spacegate
=====
Farms spacegate research in Kingdom of Loathing. Earns ~300 research + alien gemstones a day.

Installation
----------------
Run this command in the graphical CLI:
<pre>
git checkout https://github.com/Ezandora/Spacegate.git
</pre>
Will require [a recent build of KoLMafia](http://builds.kolmafia.us/job/Kolmafia/lastSuccessfulBuild/).

Usage
----------------
Type "spacegate.ash" into the graphical CLI, or select Scripts>Spacegate.ash from the menu.

The script will automatically dial a gate, and farm for twenty turns. It saves alien gemstones in your inventory, in case you want to mall sell them.
